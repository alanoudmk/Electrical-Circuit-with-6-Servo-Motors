# Connecting and Programming an Electrical Circuit with 6 Servo Motors:

## Project Description:
This project aims to control 6 servo motors by sweeping them through a range of 0 to 180 degrees in 10-degree increments, and then sweeping them back to 0 degrees in 10-degree decrements. The servo movements are synchronized, with a delay between each servo movement to create a smooth, choreographed effect.

To demonstrate this project, we will use the [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits) simulation platform, which allows us to build and test the circuit without any physical hardware.


Hardware Used:
  - Arduino Uno  
  - 6 Micro Servo Motors
  - Jumper wires or Cables
  - Breadboard


## Servo Motors:

Servo motors are a type of actuator that are widely used in various applications, such as robotics, remote-controlled devices, and automation systems. They consist of the following key components:
  - Electric Motor 
  - Gearbox 
  - Position Sensor 
  - Control Circuit 

- Range of Movement:
    - limited range of movement, usually between 0 and 180 degrees.
      
- Voltage:
    - Typically operate on a low voltage, usually in the range of 4.8 to 6 volts.


- Servo Motor Control:
    - Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) 
    - Input Signals 
    - Feedback Loop 

- Types:
    - Standard Servo Motors
    - Continuous Rotation Servo Motors 
    - High-Torque Servo Motors 
 
- Applications:
    - Robotics
    - Remote-Controlled Devices
    - Automation and Machinery

Now that we have a better understanding of servo motors, let's proceed with the project and connect and program the 6 servo motors using an Arduino Uno.
